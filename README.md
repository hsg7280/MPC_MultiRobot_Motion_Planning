## Introduction

**KoKoBot** stands for Cooperative and Collaborative Robotplatform.  KoKoBot automates optimal task planning, online trajectory planning, and collision avoidance for robots operating in dynamic surroundings, creating a safe and collaborative workplace for both robots and humans. By embracing KoKoBot, industries can unlock a new level of operational efficiency and safety, enabling optimal task execution, collision-free navigation, and harmonious collaboration between robots and human workers. The integration of the robot operating system (ROS) further enhances KoKoBotâ€™s communication, performance and adaptability.


This repository contains an implementation of optimal task execution and collision avoidance using distributed model predictive control (**DMPC**). It ensures efficient trajectory planning and safe navigation for robots by considering their predictive dynamic path with other robot's planned path. Communication between DMPCs is achieved through the Robot Operating System (ROS), enabling coordination among multiple robots.

### Structure
**KoKoBot** possesses the ability to dynamically adapt and adjust trajectories in real-time, allowing it to respond effectively to environmental changes and uncertainties. Additionally, the control scheme supports multiple robots, allowing for cooperative operation as depicted in the provided picture.

### Videos

#### Simulation

The following videos are simulated using Gazebo, illustrating how the algorithm can be scaled to a larger system with two additional robots. The videos demonstrate the robots engaging in tasks such as picking, sorting, and placing objects with seamless coordination and efficiency.

#### Real Hardware
The successful implementation with real hardware using two UR5e robots elevates the algorithm's credibility and practicality, showcasing its ability to execute the disassembly process of three trucks with remarkable precision and efficiency. This validation through real-world application reinforces the algorithm's potential for seamless coordination and opens new possibilities for its integration into various industrial scenarios.

## Documentation

KoKoBot's documentation and information is available at [WSKL-Website](https://mv.rptu.de/fgs/wskl/forschung/kokobot).


## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Ubuntu: 20.04 (preferred). 
- ROS: [Noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu)
- Universal robot gazebo simulation: [universal_robot](https://github.com/dhled/universal_robot)
- Universal Robots ROS drivers (necessary for the Hardware): [Universal_Robots_ROS_Driver](https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS_Driver).
- Robotiq 2f-85 gripper: [robotiq](https://github.com/ros-industrial/robotiq/tree/kinetic-devel)
- Inverse Kinematics for Universal robots e-series: [ur_ikfast](https://github.com/cambel/ur_ikfast)
- Python 3.8


### Python packages

Python libraries can be installed from PyPl via:
```bash
pip install casadi==3.6.3
pip install numpy==1.25.1
pip install scipy==1.7.3
```

### Building up the gazebo simulation

The following instructions assume that a [Catkin workspace](https://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace) has been created at `~/catkin_ws` and that the source space is at `~/catkin_ws/src`. Update paths appropriately if they are different on the build machine.

In all other cases the packages will have to be build from sources in a Catkin workspace:

```bash
# retrieve the sources
git clone https://github.com/ngafur/kokobot_DMPC

sudo mv ~/kokobot_DMPC/gazeboWorld ~/carkin_ws/src

cd ~/catkin_ws

# checking dependencies (again: replace '$ROS_DISTRO' with the ROS version you are using)
rosdep update
rosdep install --rosdistro $ROS_DISTRO --ignore-src --from-paths src

# building
catkin_make

# activate this workspace
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```
replace $ROS_DISTRO with Noetic, Melodic or kinetic, depending on which ROS version you have installed.

### Preparing the solver
The algorithm is using Casadi with ipopt as NLP solver, you need to define the ipopt by youself. Check this [Link](https://coin-or.github.io/Ipopt/OPTIONS.html).


## Getting Started

To run the code:

1- **Run the ROS-Master**. Actullay it is preferable to run ros-master through following command, otherwise roslaunch can be suffient.

```bash
roscore 
```

2- **Run the gezboo simulation**
after the installation of universal robot UR5e and robotiq gripper for two robots. 

```bash
roslaunch ur_e_gazebo ur5e.launch
```
3- **Run the Online trajectory planner using DMPC algorithm for two robots.**

1. First you need to open the right directory

```bash
cd ~/kokobot_OS/onlineTrajectoryPlanner
``` 

2. Start Coodinator and wait for "Waiting for start message":
```bash
python3 Coordinator.py
``` 

3. Inititalize robot (30) and wait for "Waiting for start message": 
```bash
python3 main_robot_ROS_R1.py
``` 

4. Inititalize robot (29) and wait for "Waiting for start message": 
```bash
python3 main_robot_ROS_R2.py
```

5. Synchronized Start:
```bash
python3 startSynchronized.py
```

The terminal will ask to enter "go". This must be done twice. First go will start a calculation of the trajectory and the terminal windows of the main_robot... script will output "Solve_Succeeded; Waiting for start message.". Then you can enter "go" the second time which will start the pick and place algorithm.
